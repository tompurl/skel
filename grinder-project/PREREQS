Here's what you need in order to make this project skeleton work with Grinder:

* Grinder 3.4
* Java 1.5 or greater
* The following env vars:
  * GRINDER_HOME
  * JAVA_HOME
* Adding $GRINDER_HOME/lib/grinder.jar to your CLASSPATH

Before you run the bin/startAgent.sh script, you need to have a running Grinder
console. Here's how you do that:
